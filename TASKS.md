# TASKS

Estuary 7 - fork-by-build of skin.estuary.modv2 for the Tony.7.Bones fleet.
Full phase plan + locked decisions: `docs/PLAN.md`. Project rules: `CLAUDE.md`.

## Phase status

- [x] **Phase 0 - Scaffold + groundwork** (2026-07-10, commit `13b7ebd`). Upstream
      pinned at `8d9b2c7c` = 21.4+omega.4, verified byte-identical to the fleet's
      stock skin via the Office box `.bak` snapshots; tarball sha256 in
      `skin_build.lock`. Proxy `request()` 302-following live-verified (plain
      release-asset URLs work). NOTE: upstream Omega head is ALREADY 21.4+omega.5 -
      the rebase to it is a deliberate exercise AFTER the baseline ships.
- [x] **Phase 1 - Build pipeline** (2026-07-10). `tools/skin_transforms.py`
      (15 anchored fail-loud file edits + rebrand + 46-file [B] sweep +
      Font.xml Estuary-weights + baked opt-out defaults), `tools/build_skin.py`
      (sha256-verified fetch, transform, ship-contract checks, deterministic
      zip; `--check` double-builds and byte-compares), `assets/` (16 shipped
      skinshortcuts files + wordmark, seeded from the goldens), `tests/`
      (70 passing: anchors incl. mutation/fail-loud, golden parity vs the
      1.8.0 bytes, no-bold contracts, baked-default contracts, rebrand,
      determinism). dist zip sha256 in `skin_build.lock`. NOTE for Phases 4/5:
      skinshortcuts reads `<skinid>.properties` ONLY from its addon_data - the
      re-keyed copy shipped at `shortcuts/skin.estuary7.properties` must be
      seeded by Setup's `_install_skin` (Phase 4) / the migrator (Phase 5);
      the DATA files ARE consumed natively as skin defaults.
- [x] **Phase 2 - First release + hosting** (2026-07-10). Public repo
      `moquette/estuary7` (owner decision: moquette, not tony7bones - no
      tony7bones GitHub credentials on this machine; transfer later is safe,
      GitHub redirects). Release v1.0.0 with the 94MB zip asset; anonymous
      download sha256-verified against the build. tony7bones.github.io:
      `addons/hosted/skin.estuary7/` metadata + repository.json entry (zip
      template -> the release asset URL), shipped via proxy release 2.2.7.
      End-to-end verified through the REAL proxy engine: full 98,631,598-byte
      stream sha256-matches the build, live addons.xml lists skin.estuary7
      1.0.0 with the full requires closure, icon/fanart resolve.
- [x] **Phase 3 - Device verify** (2026-07-10, Office Fire TV 192.168.7.162).
      Estuary 7 1.0.0 installed alongside MOD V2 (adb push + boot rescan +
      SetAddonEnabled), switched live, screencap parity vs the 1.8.0 overlay
      baseline: home (six thin items, wordmark, thin clock, top-bar weather
      w/ outline icon, plain shortcut icons), widgets, gear order, thin
      SkinSettings nav + our "Estuary 7" category/toggle/breadcrumb, PVR
      regular headers, Classic-list power menu. Live-skin greps: zero [B],
      zero bold binds, zero non-lyr style-bold. Survived restart; reverted to
      MOD V2 in one switch (overlay intact) - rollback exercised BOTH ways.
      CONFIRMED on hardware: fresh skin shows menu but NO widgets until the
      skinshortcuts properties is seeded into addon_data (seed + hash drop +
      restart fixed it) - Phase 4 setup / Phase 5 migrator MUST do this.
      FLAGGED for owner: upstream "ESTUARY MOD V2" logo artwork still shows in
      the SkinSettings window corner (cosmetic; candidate 1.0.1 transform).
      Box end state: MOD V2 + overlay 1.8.0 active (modv2plus updated from
      1.6.3 via push), Estuary 7 installed alongside. ATV by-eye check still
      open (tvOS cannot screenshot; owner's call).
- [ ] **Phase 4 - Setup/library/tests** in tony7bones.github.io (SKIN_ID flip,
      probes simplify, EXPECTED_NET_INSTALLED).
- [ ] **Phase 5 - Fleet migration**: modv2plus 2.0.0 one-shot migrator
      (disarmed first), box-by-box, rollback = one skin switch.
- [ ] **Phase 6 - Retirement + docs**: retire modv2plus, correct the playbook's
      wrong "MIT" license note (upstream = GPL-2.0 code + CC-BY-SA-4.0 art).

## Bench state (Office Fire TV 192.168.7.162)

- Since 2026-07-10 (1.0.1 tweak round): Estuary 7 ACTIVE; BOTH
  `script.tony7bones.modv2plus` AND `skin.estuary.modv2` DISABLED (deliberate
  end-state soak - the fork standing with zero overlay machinery). Both stay
  INSTALLED: modv2plus 1.8.0 is the future Phase 5 migrator, and the MOD V2
  skin dir keeps the applied overlay + .baks frozen (disabled add-ons do not
  auto-update, so no Kodinerds clobber is possible). Rollback = re-enable
  both, switch skins - seconds, no downloads. The other six boxes keep
  everything enabled until Phase 5.

## Deferred / revisit later

- **Phase 4/5 MUST handle the proxy's 1h manifest cache** (learned on the ATV
  2026-07-10): the proxy service caches its GENERATED addons.xml for an hour
  (LoadingCache TTL) and Kodi's "Check for updates" / full Kodi restarts do
  NOT reliably bust a bad/stale build - the deterministic refresh is the
  proxy's own update endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/update`, exposed in
  the add-on menu as "Update repository", or
  `Addons.ExecuteAddon(repository.tony7bones, update_repository)`). Any
  repo-resolved install of skin.estuary7 right after a proxy release must hit
  that endpoint first or the skin may be invisible to the resolver.

- **Skin Settings category order**: revisit in a future round. The 1.0.1
  order (commit 6158a83) leads with stock Estuary's sequence (General, Home
  menu, Artworks, Music OSD, Video OSD) and appends MOD V2's extra panels
  (Library, PVR & Live TV, Colors, Extras, Necessary add-ons) in upstream
  relative order - the tail placement was a judgment call, not an owner
  decision. Reordering is safe anytime: panes gate on item ids, and the
  transform is one data table (`_CATEGORY_ORDER_STOCK` in
  `tools/skin_transforms.py`).

## Standing constraints

- The fleet stays on overlay 1.8.0 until Phase 5; nothing here touches boxes
  before then.
- Every phase: implement -> test -> gate -> QA -> real-device verify -> document
  -> commit. No hardware claim without proof.
