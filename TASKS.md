# TASKS

Estuary 7 - fork-by-build of skin.estuary.modv2 for the Tony.7.Bones fleet.
Full phase plan + locked decisions: `docs/PLAN.md`. Project rules: `CLAUDE.md`.

## Phase status

- [x] **Phase 0 - Scaffold + groundwork** (2026-07-10, commit `13b7ebd`). Upstream
      pinned at `8d9b2c7c` = 21.4+omega.4, verified byte-identical to the fleet's
      stock skin via the Office box `.bak` snapshots; tarball sha256 in
      `skin_build.lock`. Proxy `request()` 302-following live-verified (plain
      release-asset URLs work). NOTE: upstream Omega head is ALREADY 21.4+omega.5 -
      the rebase to it is a deliberate exercise AFTER the baseline ships.
- [x] **Phase 1 - Build pipeline** (2026-07-10). `tools/skin_transforms.py`
      (15 anchored fail-loud file edits + rebrand + 46-file [B] sweep +
      Font.xml Estuary-weights + baked opt-out defaults), `tools/build_skin.py`
      (sha256-verified fetch, transform, ship-contract checks, deterministic
      zip; `--check` double-builds and byte-compares), `assets/` (16 shipped
      skinshortcuts files + wordmark, seeded from the goldens), `tests/`
      (70 passing: anchors incl. mutation/fail-loud, golden parity vs the
      1.8.0 bytes, no-bold contracts, baked-default contracts, rebrand,
      determinism). dist zip sha256 in `skin_build.lock`. NOTE for Phases 4/5:
      skinshortcuts reads `<skinid>.properties` ONLY from its addon_data - the
      re-keyed copy shipped at `shortcuts/skin.estuary7.properties` must be
      seeded by Setup's `_install_skin` (Phase 4) / the migrator (Phase 5);
      the DATA files ARE consumed natively as skin defaults.
- [ ] **Phase 2 - First release + hosting** (NEXT): public GitHub repo, `gh release`
      v1.0.0 asset, hosted metadata + repository.json entry + proxy release in
      tony7bones.github.io.
- [ ] **Phase 3 - Device verify**: Office Fire TV side-by-side skin switch,
      screencap parity of every tweak; ATV by eye.
- [ ] **Phase 4 - Setup/library/tests** in tony7bones.github.io (SKIN_ID flip,
      probes simplify, EXPECTED_NET_INSTALLED).
- [ ] **Phase 5 - Fleet migration**: modv2plus 2.0.0 one-shot migrator
      (disarmed first), box-by-box, rollback = one skin switch.
- [ ] **Phase 6 - Retirement + docs**: retire modv2plus, correct the playbook's
      wrong "MIT" license note (upstream = GPL-2.0 code + CC-BY-SA-4.0 art).

## Standing constraints

- The fleet stays on overlay 1.8.0 until Phase 5; nothing here touches boxes
  before then.
- Every phase: implement -> test -> gate -> QA -> real-device verify -> document
  -> commit. No hardware claim without proof.
